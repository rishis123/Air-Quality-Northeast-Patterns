# Air-Quality-Northeast-Patterns

The aim of this project is to predict, choosing one amongst a handful of machine learning algortihms, air quality patterns in the near future for the Northeastern United States, namely the states of 
Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The air quality metrics used are Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur, and Ozone. This data is publicly available from the US government (https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html#Annual) -- this is the CSV download. 
The project was inspired by recent declines in the Northeast air quality due to Canadian wildfires.
